# Open Data for Nonprofit Research



----------

A slightly updated list of datasets is available on the [Nonprofit Open Data Collective website](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/overview/).

There is a new package for harvesting IRS 990 Efile data and converting XML files into a well-structured database: 

[https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/irs990efile](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/irs990efile)

Stay tuned: several datasets and packages will be released in Fall 2022! 

[https://github.com/orgs/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/repositories)

----------

The IRS maintains several important nonprofit databases to track the current population of exempt organizations, their annual 990 filings, and organizations that have closed. This data has been released in formats that are not always easy to use - ASCII text files, json files, and XML queries. 

In order to make the data accessible to the research community, we have created scripts to download data from IRS websites, clean and process it, and export into familiar formats (CSV, Stata, SPSS, etc.).

We have begun the process to catalog and document these resources, and will begin sharing them through the Nonprofit Open Data Collective portal:

The most up-to-date files are posted on [Data World](https://data.world/activity/npdata).

But we also have some legacy files on our [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/NIOD) site.

<br>


# Available Data

We have documented and posted the following open data assets:

1. **IRS E-Filer Database:** All nonprofit 990 data that is filed electronically, about 60% of nonprofits.
2. **Index of all E-Filers from 2009 to Present:** A list of all organizations that have electronically filed each year.
3. **Current Exempt Organizations:** The current list of all tax-exempt organizations.
4. **IRS Business Master File:** Organizational characteristics of all current exempt organizations.
5. **990N Postcard Filers:** Data on nonprofits that are small enough to file the abbreviated "postcard" version of the 990 form.
6. **IRS Automatic Revocations:"** Database of nonprofits that had their tax exempt status revoked for failing to file.
7. **Organizations Granted Tax Exempt Status through 1023-EZ Form:** Data filed electronically on the new shorter 1023-EZ application for 501(c) status.

The National Center for Charitable Statistics at the Urban Institute has opened up their data archives!

## (1) IRS E-Filer 990 Data 

The IRS has released all nonprofit 990 tax data that has been e-filed through their online system, approximately 60-65% of all 990-PC and 990-EZ filers. It is available for years 2012 to current years with a small set of returns avaialable for 2010 and 2011. The data has been posted as XML files in an [Amazon Web Server (AWS) Cloud Server](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/). More details about the data and the push to have it made public are below.

In order to support use of this data, we have converted the XML files into a research database similar to the NCCS Core dataset.

#### Resources for the AWS Data

Charity Navigator has created an open-source [990 Toolkit](http://990.charitynavigator.org/) that allows you to set up an Amazon EC2 instance and clone the full IRS dataset as a relational database. You can read their press release about the project [here](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=4669).

Chad Kruse at SmarterGiving has a script to convert 990-PF XML files into a MongoDB database on GitHub [here](https://github.com/smartergiving/irs-990-fetch).

You can find some useful scripts here for running queries directly within the cloud and downloading data as CSV files, for example [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/ryankanno/a5da4c6f1f8e0136db9623ae1903d23d#form-990).

If you are more comfortable in Python, check out Yash Nanavati's [GitHup repo](https://github.com/yashvardhannanavati/IRS990-Data-Analysis).

There are some forums on using the E-Filer data, for example [this reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/4p772f/how_the_heck_do_i_view_the_990_documents_on/).



<br>



## (2) Index of 990, 990-EZ and 990-PF Electronic Filers from 2009 to Present

We provide an R script that builds the INDEX file (not the full dataset) for all IRS E-Filer open data provided on the Amazon Web Server. The index contains a limited number of variables such as nonprofit name, EIN, tax year, form type, and the URL link to the XML form of the 990 return data. This index file allows you to see what is available in the open E-Filer database.

 **FORM** | 2009 |  2010 |  2011  | 2012  | 2013  | 2014 |  2015

**990EZ** | 15,500 | 63.253 |  82,066 |  93,769 | 104,425  | 114,822  | 60,967
**990PF**  | 2,352 | 25,275  | 34,597  | 39,936 | 45,870  | 52,617  | 34,387

## (3) List of all Current Exempt Organizations (all orgs granted 501(c)(3) status)  


The [IRS Publication 78](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/forwardToPub78Download.do) contains a list of all organizations that currently have 501(c)(3) tax exempt status and are in good standing (eligible to receive tax-deductible donations) under IRS code.


[ [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/lecy/Open-Data-for-Nonprofit-Research/blob/master/Open_Nonprofit_Datasets/IRS_Current_Exempt_Orgs_List.Rmd) ]  [ [Link to Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/Z4PZOG) ]


<br>


## (4) Business Master File of All Current Exempt Orgs

The [IRS Exempt Organization Business Master File Extract (EO BMF)](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf) contains information on all active nonprofits including basic information about nonprofit location, ruling date (when they were granted tax exempt status), and activities. Note that the NTEE codes are noisy and incomplete. It is recommended to use the NCCS codes instead.

<br>



## (5) All 990-N Postcard Filers

Most small tax-exempt organizations whose annual gross receipts are normally $50,000 or less can satisfy their annual reporting requirement by electronically submitting Form 990-N if they choose not to file Form 990 or Form 990-EZ instead. Exceptions to this requirement include:

* Organizations that are included in a group return
* Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches
* Organizations required to file a different return

The Postcard Filers dataset contains close to a million cases from the following years:

 2007 |  2008 |  2009 |  2010 |  2011  | 2012  | 2013  | 2014 |  2015 |  2016 
------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|------|-------|-----------
26,969 | 28,704 | 45,846 | 31,734 | 36,457  | 36,779 | 52,202 | 120,831 | 475,084  | 65,211

<br>

## (6) All Organizations with a Revoked 501(c)(.) Status

Nonprofits that fail to file 990 returns for three years have their 501(c)(3) tax exempt status automatically revoked by the IRS. This dataset contains more than 670,000 cases for the following years:

2010 |  2011 |  2012 |  2013 |  2014 |  2015  | 2016
-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------
372,717 |  92,360  | 47,506  |  52,111  | 36,973  | 36,935  | 35,046

<br>


## (7) Organizations Granted Tax Exempt Status through 1023-EZ Form

This dataset contains information on nonprofits that have been granted tax-exempt status through the new 1023-EZ form, a more compact and simplified version of the original 1023 form. These data do not include organizations that filed for exempt status through the original 1023 form, nor those that filed via paper forms sent to the IRS through the mail. The forms and criteria for submitting a 1023-EZ can be found here:
